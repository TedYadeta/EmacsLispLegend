C-x 5 2              = Start a new window on your screen.
C-x b $FILE <Return> = Return to $FILE from another buffer
C-x f                = Set Margin
C-x k, then <Return> = Stop the Tutorial
C-x o                = Move cursor to another window
C-x s                = Save some buffers
C-x b $BUFFER        = Check $BUFFER

II) Meta Chords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
